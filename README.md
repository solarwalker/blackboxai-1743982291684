# PlantMed - Plant Identification App

## Project Overview
PlantMed is a web application designed to help users identify plants and understand their medicinal uses through image recognition. By uploading a photo of a plant, users can receive detailed information about its name, medicinal properties, scientific classification, and family. Utilizing TensorFlow.js for machine learning and dynamic web technologies, the application provides a user-friendly experience for plant enthusiasts and herbalists alike.

## Installation
To set up the PlantMed application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd plantmed
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**  
   No additional setup is required as all scripts and styles are linked from CDNs.

## Usage
1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Click to upload plant photo" area and choose an image of a plant in JPG or PNG format.
3. The app will display a preview of the uploaded image and start analyzing it.
4. After processing, the results will show the identified plant name, its medicinal uses, and other relevant scientific information.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface for uploading images.
- Real-time plant identification and information retrieval.
- Displays detailed data including scientific name, family, uses, and preparation methods of the plant.
- Loader animation while the image is being processed.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.

## Dependencies
The application uses the following external libraries:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling the web interface.
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - For running machine learning models in the browser.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application structure and layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles image upload, plant analysis, user interaction, and data retrieval.
- `data.json`: Contains a database of plants with their names, uses, scientific classification, and precautions.
- `convert_model.py`: A Python script to convert a PyTorch plant classification model to TensorFlow.js format.
- `model/`: Directory containing the TensorFlow.js model and related files used for plant classification.

## Important Considerations
- Ensure that the model files are correctly loaded in the `model` directory for the application to function properly.
- The models are currently set to recognize a predefined set of plants; further training and data addition may enhance the recognition capabilities.

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
